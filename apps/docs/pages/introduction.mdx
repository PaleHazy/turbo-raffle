## What is Turbo-Raffle?

Turbo Raffle is at its core a drop shipping raffle application.
Turbo raffle seeks to incorporate with existing market place API's to allow users to create and participate in raffles for products.

As a starting market we have selected https://www.tcgplayer.com/ and will be interfacing with Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh!, Pokemon, Digimon, and Flesh and Blood trading cards.

- Users will purchase our site currency which will allow them to then purchase tickets in a raffle, or create a new raffle.
- Each ticket purchased will award the user with a product from the specific product category of the raffle if/when the raffle is completed. (Magic, Yu-Gi-Oh!, etc...). 
- Products won will then be redeemable for the real world item or cashed back in for their real world value in our site currency.
- Users will be able to earn achievements for spending our currency participating in and winning raffles.
